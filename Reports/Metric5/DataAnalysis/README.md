<h2><strong>Metric 5: Code churn measures</strong></h2>
<p><br />Code churn measures quantify how much change is occurring in your project. In general, high levels of churn indicate project instability. You should expect high rates of churn at the start of a product cycle or after the team has implemented many changes. Toward the end of an iteration or before a release, you should expect the level of churn to decrease, which indicates that your project is more stable.</p>
<p><br />By using these measures, you can create reports that show how many file versions are stored in Team Foundation version control and how much the code has changed. You can analyze metrics by file directory, build, or team member who checked in changes, and you can determine how those metrics change over time.</p>
